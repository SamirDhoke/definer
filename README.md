## Definer
- This is my first shot at developing a chrome extension.
- To test it
    1. clone this repo
    2. enable developer mode in your `chrome://extensions`
    3. click on the "Load Unpacked" button and choose this repo folder
    4. go to [any website](https://www.google.com)
    5. select a word by double clicking it (make sure it's not a link).
    6. open the extension from toolbar.
    7. you will see the definition if that word exists in the API.
- I have used the [Owlbot](https://owlbot.info/) API for fetching definitions
- I basically followed [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) and his set of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bL9VOMT65ahNEri9uqLWfS) about developing a chrome extensions. Highly recommended.
